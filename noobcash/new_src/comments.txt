Noobcash backend

The logic of the blockchain is implemented in the Noobcash backend. 
The basic components are the following:

  Noobcash Block:
    index: Number of Block (1,2,3...)
    timestamp: Time of block creation
    transactions: List of a transactions contained in a Block 
    nonce: Proof-Of-Work' solution
    current_hash: Current Block's plaintext which is now a unique hash digest that cannot be reverted to the origina plaintext
    previous_hash: Previous Block's hash digest

    The space of each block for transactions is limited by the constant capacity.

  Noobcash Blockchain:
    The list of blocks which are verified

  Wallet:
    A wallet is associated with a public/private key pair. 

    The public key acts as an address of the wallet, which a process/user can share with anyone in order to get NBCs. 

    The private key is used to sign transactions. With its used it is ensured that only the wallet owner can spend NBCs from the specific wallet. The sign_transaction function implements this functionality.

    Anyone who knows the public key of a wallet can verify that a transaction was created by its owner.

  Transaction:
    Each transaction contains information for Noobcash Coins transfers from one wallet to another.

    sender_address          = Wallet's public key NBCs are originated.
    receiver_address        = Wallet's public key in which NBCs will be transferred.
    amount                  = Exact number of NBCs.
    transaction_id          = A transaction hash/ID is a unique identifier that serves as a proof that
                              a transaction was validated and added to the blockhain.
    transaction_inputs      = Contains information for the exchange history of NBCs in each transaction
                              and it is constituted by the previousOutputId which is the TransactionOutputId
                              from which the NBCs are originated.
    transaction_outputs     = Contains a unique ID identifier, the transaction ID which is originated,
                              the new owner of the NBCs' and the exact number of NBCs transferred.

    A transaction can be created by the wallet owner from which NBCs will be transferred.
    Each transaction gets broadcasted in all the blockhain members.
    During the acceptance of a transaction from any node, the validate_transaction function
    is called in order to verify its validity.

    Transaction Input:
      Contains information for the history of NBCs transferred (previous transactions) and the destination block.
      It is consisted by PreviousOutputId field, which is the Transaction Output from which the amount of NBCs
      is originated.


    Transaction Output:
      It is consisted by a unique identifier, the id of transaction which it is originated, the new owner of the NBCs (recipient) and the amount transferred.

    Unspent Transactions:
      Every transaction creates outputs which include information for the amount of NBCs which each transaction sent 
      in its participants. 
    
      In our case, we assume transactions made only between 2 wallets, so each transaction 
      concludes in two transaction outputs. 
       One output for the receiver_address wallet with the amount of NBCs
       One output for the sender_address with the remaining amount of NBCs.

      Only unspent transactions outputs (UTXOs) can be used as inputs for next transactions.
      In this way double spending is prevented. Consequently, UTXOs are necessary for a transaction to be made.

      The ending amount of a wallet is the summary of all UTXOs which have as recipient the specific wallet.

      In order not to run through the whole blockchain to check if the inputs of a transaction are indeed UTXOs,
      every node has the current summary of UTXOs for every wallet.
